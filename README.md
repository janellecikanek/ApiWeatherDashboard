# ApiWeatherDashboard

## Description

I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. Given a weather dashboard with form inputs when I search for a city then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When I view current weather conditions for that city then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed. WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity when I click on a city in the search history then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

This project has helped with my understanding of Java Script and APIs.
